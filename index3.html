		<p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px; text-decoration:underline">Let's begin with some basics.</p>
		<h3>What is crocheting?</h3>
		<p>Crocheting is a type of yarn and needle work. It's main tool is a single rod with a small hook 
		on the end. As opposed to knitting in which one is weaving yarn on itself,<br> crocheting is essentially
		a way of tying the yarn to itself.
		If you want to know more about crocheting, check out this 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crochet">Wikipedia article.</a>
		</p>
		<h3>Can it be done if I am left-handed?</h3>
		<p>Yes! It does not matter what hand you use. Being left handed should not be the reason you do not give
		crocheting a chance.</p>
		<h3>What do I need to get started?</h3>
		<p>You do not need much to get started. You will just need a crochet hook and some yarn. You do not need
		to spend your life savings on this hobby. Hobby Lobby and Michaels <br> have some reasonably priced yarn and 
		hooks. If these stores are not near you, Walmart does as well. There is no shaming in buying from Walmart!</p>
		<h3>Does the type of yarn I buy matter?<img src="RedHeart1.jpg" alt="yarn_weight" height=500 style="float:right"></h3>
		<p>The brand of yarn that you wish to use is completely up to you. I would suggest, however, that you not 
		buy an expensive skein of yarn when you are just starting out. What <br> you need to remember, though, is that 
		you need to match up the <i>weight</i> of the yarn to the size of your hook. I am not talking about how
		many ounces the skein is.</p>
		<p>On the skein of yarn of your choosing, there should be a symbol that looks something like this one.
		This tells you the yarn weight, which is basically how thick the yarn is. <br> This is a 4 weight yarn, so 
		I would need a I-9 hook (or one that is about 5.5 mm). For a breakdown of what size hook you need, check
		out <a href="http://www.craftyarncouncil.com/weight.html">this link.</a> </p>
		<h3>How long will it take to learn?</h3>
		<p>There is no set time it will take to learn. Everyone has their own pace. However, do not expect to learn overnight.
		Like most things, it takes lots of practice to get good at <br> crocheting. One has to get used to holding the yarn and to 
		what abbreviations mean and so on. It is a good amount of work, but it is definitely worth it in the end.</p>
		<h3>What should I do once I learn the basic stitches?</h3>
		<p>There is a world of possibilites out there. There are endless patterns available for free on the internet. I would 
		recommend starting with one of the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Granny Squares</li>
				<li>Scarves</li>
				<li>Simple Blankets</li>
			</ol>
		<p>These are generally simple projects that will get you used to reading and following a pattern.</p>
