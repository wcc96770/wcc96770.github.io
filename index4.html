		<p style="font-size:18px">To be honest, the best way to learn how to crochet is to watch others. It is fairly difficult to learn from reading something,
		but it is much easier to learn by watching. That is how I learned when I was little. <br>My grandmother did not verbally teach me; 
		instead she would crochet and I would watch her and try to imitate what her hands were doing.</p>
		<p style="font-size:18px">The best help I can give you is to point you towards some helpful links. Of course, you are more than welcome to find your own to watch.
		I just thought I would recommend some of the ones that I like.</p>
		<p style="font-size:18px"><a href="http://www.redheart.com/learn-to-crochet">Red Heart</a><br>This offers a plethora of helpful articles, and many of them have videos with them. They do, however,
		seem to be primarily for right-handed people.</p>
		<p style="font-size:18px"><a href="http://www.redheart.com/how-to/articles/ultimate-guide-to-left-handed-crochet">Red Heart (left-handed)</a><br>This is a good beginning guide for those who will be wanting to 
		learn how to crochet left handed.</p>
		<p style="font-size:18px"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11iw-yBGm-k">The Crochet Crowd</a><br>This video offers a good tutorial on the basics. The channel also has a lot of pattern demonstraions,
		so once you learn you have access to a large library of possible projects.</p>
		<p style="font-size:18px"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAqlSW4K06E">The Crochet Crowd (left-handed)</a>This is a video from the same channel as before, and it offers the same good tutorial on the 
		basics of crocheting but for those who are left-handed.</p>
		<p style="font-size:30px; font-family:Bradley Hand ITC"><br><br><br>I hope that this helps! I wish you all the best of luck with your newfound skill!</p>
